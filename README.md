notifications
=============

This repo is aimed to easily manage android notifications - sort of convenience library.
Please check open.java.example package for its usage(s).
This library is currently under development so a lot of missing things are likely to be added.
I have no plans for writing tests now but unit tests should follow soon once a significant amount of
development is done.

Contributions and suggestions appreciated.
