notifications
=============

The android notification APIs are well written and easy to use. The motivation for this repo is to separate 
android dependencies from the usual Java code written for the app. Thus it is more of a wrapper library.
Please check open.java.example package for its usage(s).
This library is currently under development so a lot of missing things are likely to be added.
I have no plans for writing tests now but unit tests should follow soon once a significant amount of
development is done.

Contributions and suggestions appreciated.
